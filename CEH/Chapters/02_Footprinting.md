Footprinting: collect information about a target network

Passive Footprinting: collect without direct interaction
Active Footprinting: collect with direct interaction

Information collected:
	-Organization Information (phone numbers, employee details, ...)
	-Network Information (Domains, IPs, ...)
	-System Information (OSes, passwords)

Objectives of Footprinting:

Know Security Posture :
	know the security posture of the target organization
Reduce Focus Area:
	reduce the attackers focus area to a specific range of IP, network,
	domain names, ...
Identify Vulnerabilities:
	identify vulnerabilities in the target system
Draw Network Map:
	draw a map or outline the target organization's network 
	infrastructure

Social Network Footprinting:
	Get infromation about the target

Website Footprinting
	Information about the target through web pages
	
	-Examining the web page's source code
	-Examining cookies
	-Extarcting metadata of web sites
	-Monitoring website for updates
	-Tracking email (tool ?)
	-Email header analysis
	-Competitive Intelligence Gathering
	-Monitoring website traffic
	-Tracking online reputation
	-WHOIS
	-IP geolocation
	-DNS footprinting 


#WHOIS
Whois databases are maintained by Regional Internet Registries and
contain personal information of domain owner

TCP port 43

#DNS footprinting
DNS record type:
	A - Points to a host's IP address
	MX - Points to a domain's mail server
	NS - Points to a host's name server
	CNAME - Canonical naming allows aliases to a host
	SOA - Indocate authority for domain
	SRV - Service records
	PTR - Maps IP address to a hostname
	RP - Responsible person
	HINFO - Host information record includes CPU type and OS
	TXT - Unstructured text records
